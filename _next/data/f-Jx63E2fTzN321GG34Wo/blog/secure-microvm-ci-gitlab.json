From large enterprise companies who are concerned about the security risks of running CI with privileged Docker containers, Docker socket binding (from the host!) or the flakey nature and slow speed of VFS with Docker In Docker (DIND).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/\">GitLab docs have a stark warning</a> about using both of these approaches. It was no surprise that when a consultant at Thoughtworks reached out to me, he listed off the pain points and concerns that we'd set out to solve for GitHub Actions.</p>\n<p>At KubeCon, I also spoke to several developers who worked at Deutsche Telekom who had numerous frustrations with the user-experience and management overhead of the Kubernetes executor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So with growing interest from customers, we built a solution for GitLab CI - just like we did for GitHub Actions. We're excited to share it with you today in tech preview.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/2023-06-gitlab-preview/conceptual.png\" alt=\"actuated for GitLab CI\"></p>\n<p>For every build that requires a runner, we will schedule and boot a complete system with Firecracker using Linux KVM for secure isolation. After the job is completed, the VM will be destroyed and removed from the GitLab instance.</p>\n<p>actuated for GitLab is for self-hosted GitLab instances, whether hosted on-premises or on the public cloud.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to use it or find out more, please apply here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA12IGyVFrZtSAp2Oj24OdaSMloqARSwoxx3AZbQbs0wpGww/viewform\">Sign-up for the Actuated pilot</a></p>\n<h2>Secure CI with Firecracker microVMs</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker\">Firecracker</a> is the open-source technology that provides isolation between tenants on certain AWS products like Lambda and Fargate. There's a growing number of cloud native solutions evolving around Firecracker, and we believe that it's the only way to run CI/CD securely.</p>\n<p>Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and manage microVMs. It's lightweight, fast, and most importantly, provides proper isolation, which anything based upon Docker cannot.</p>\n<p>There are no horrible Kernel tricks or workarounds to be able to use user namespaces, no need to change your tooling from what developers love - Docker, to Kaninko or Buildah or similar.</p>\n<p>You'll get <code>sudo</code>, plus a fresh Docker engine in every VM, booted up with systemd, so things like Kubernetes work out of the box, if you need them for end to end testing (as so many of us do these days).</p>\n<p>You can learn the differences between VMs, containers and microVMs like Firecracker in my video from Cloud Native Rejekts at KubeCon Amsterdam:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTQ_jVYhAoc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Many people have also told me that they learned how to use Firecracker from my webinar last year with Richard Case: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYCsa5e2vqg\">A cracking time: Exploring Firecracker &#x26; MicroVMs</a>.</p>\n<h2>Let's see it then</h2>\n<p>Here's a video demo of the tech preview we have available for customers today.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PybSPduDT6s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>You'll see that when I create a commit in our self-hosted copy of GitLab Enterprise, within 1 second a microVM is booting up and running the CI job.</p>\n<p>Shortly after that the VM is destroyed which means there are absolutely no side-effects or any chance of leakage between jobs.</p>\n<p>Here's a later demo of three jobs within a single pipeline, all set to run in parallel.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s 3x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gitlab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GitLab</a> CI jobs running in parallel within the same Pipeline demoed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexellisuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@alexellisuk</a> <br><br>All in their own ephemeral VM powered by Firecracker ðŸ”¥<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cicd?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cicd</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/secure?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#secure</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/isolation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#isolation</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/microvm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#microvm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/baremetal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#baremetal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fe5HaxMsGB\">pic.twitter.com/fe5HaxMsGB</a></p>&mdash; actuated (@selfactuated) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/selfactuated/status/1668575246952136704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Everything's completed before I have a chance to even open the logs in the UI of GitLab.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>actuated for GitLab is for self-hosted GitLab instances, whether hosted on-premises or on the public cloud.</p>\n<p>Here's what we bring to the table:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ðŸš€ Faster x86 builds</li>\n<li>ðŸš€ Secure isolation with Firecracker microVMs</li>\n<li>ðŸš€ Native Arm builds that can actually finish</li>\n<li>ðŸš€ Fixed-costs &#x26; less management</li>\n<li>ðŸš€ Insights into CI usage across your organisation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Runners are registered and running a job in a dedicated VM within less than one second.
