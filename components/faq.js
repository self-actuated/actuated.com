  {
    question: "How much time do I need to invest to try actuated?",
    answer:
      "You probably need to set aside 30 minutes to follow our quickstart guide and get your builds running on actuated. For regular Intel/AMD builds, edit your workflow YAML and change the runs-on field to either \"actuated\" or \"actuated-aarch64\".",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I have to register interest?",
    answer:"Whilst we have customers live in production and use actuated ourselves at OpenFaaS Ltd, we want to make sure we can support your team and rank which features you want to see coming on the roadmap. If you budget for our service, we'll very likely be able to work with you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support do you offer?",
    answer:
      "For the pilot, every customer is invited to a Slack channel for collaboration and fast support. We have quite a bit of operational experience with GitHub Actions, Docker and Kubernetes and we're making time to help you tune your builds up to get the most out of them.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of machines do I need?",
    answer:
      "You can use your own physical servers, nested virtualisation with cloud VMs or rent instances paid by the hour.",
    link: "https://docs.actuated.dev/add-agent/"
  },
  {
    question: "Can we turn machines off overnight to save money?",
    answer:
      "If you have little to no activity overnight, and want to optimise your costs, you can power cycle your agents with a cron schedule. Actuated will launch VMs for your jobs when the agents are available again.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does actuated compare to Actions Runtime Controller or the stand-alone self-hosted runner?",
    answer:
      "You can find a detailed comparison in the FAQ in the docs.",
      link: "https://docs.actuated.dev/faq",
  },
  {
    question: "How much faster is an ARM build than using hosted runners?",
    answer:
      "In our testing of the open source Parca project, we got the build time down from 33 minutes to 1 minute simply by changing to a real ARM runner instead of using QEMU.",

  },
  {
    question: "How do I launch jobs in parallel?",
    answer:
      "Have a look at the examples in our docs for matrix builds. Each job within the workflow will be launched in a separate, parallel VM.",
    link: 'https://docs.actuated.dev/'
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost? What is the right plan for our team?",
    answer: "For pilot customers, we have unmetered billing, which means you can use as many build minutes as you like, with one flat fee. The initial tier comes with 5 concurrent builds across one host, and as you increase, you get more RAM/CPU per job, more build agents and more parallel jobs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How mature is actuated?",
    answer:
      "Actuated is built on battle tested technology that's run in production at huge scale by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and GitHub. Our solution is already being used by us and our customers to save time and increase efficiency.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find detailed information about actuated?",
    answer: "We cover most common questions in much more detail over in the FAQ in the docs.",
    link: 'https://docs.actuated.dev/faq'
